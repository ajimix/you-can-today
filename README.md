## [You can today](http://you-can-today.herokuapp.com) server and code

I created this project to learn a little more of heroku platform [you-can-today.herokuapp.com](http://you-can-today.herokuapp.com).

If you want to hack into it you'll need `nodejs`. After node is installed and source cloned, run `npm install` to install project dependencies and then `node server.js` to have your server up and running.

You can now access to localhost:8080 to see the small app.

Take into account that the small built server just serves index.html and api calls.
